    <div class="about-text">The RMMR group develops new magnetic resonance imaging methods to expand the range of questions that MRI can answer. We work to make MRI more useful in challenging populations (<i>e.g.,</i> subjects who can't stay still), expanding fast, accurate neuroimaging to the very young, old, and ill. We also work to make MRI more sensitive to lifespan changes and disease processes, helping better understand them in the lab and in life.</div>

      <div class="project-header">Motion-Resilient Neuroimaging</div>
      <div class="project-text">Motion is a significant issue for both clinical and research MRI, making it difficult to acquire high-quality images in many populations. To address this challenge, we develop neuroimaging methods that are resilient to motion. One of our most widely used innovations is the Volumetric Navigators (vNavs) system &mdash; low-resolution volumes, acquired rapidly during an MRI scan, registered on-the-fly to track subject motion, and combined with dynamic MRI sequences that can adapt in real-time to correct for subject motion. </div>
       <div class="project-text">This method is now used in several multi-center studies, including <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1878929317301214">Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development</a> and <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811918318652">Human Connectome Project Aging and Development</a>. We continue to improve and expand the technology based on feedback from our collaborators. For example, we are currently refining the system for toddlers and infants as part of the <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2019/03/prenatal-early-childhood-brain-development-healthy-brain-child-development-study">HEALthy Brain and Child Development</a> planning phase.</div>
      <div class="project-text">The image below shows the effect of motion-corrected adaptive scanning, starting with a motion-damaged scan &mdash; move the slider right to see the results of intelligently reacquiring data in periods where the subject was still, replacing motion-damaged measurements with motion-corrected ones.</div>

      <div class="project-header u-full-width">MRI Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration</div>
      <div class="project-text">We are developing novel MRI methods, both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> to study neurodegenerative diseases. <i>Ex vivo</i> MRI offers a bridge between <i>in vivo</i> imaging and histopathology. While histopathology allows us to observe the  microscopic changes in tissue structure or cellular composition caused by disease, the spatial scale of these mthods is quite limited. <i>Ex vivo</i> MRI offers an opportunity to search out mesocopic changes in tissue at the scale of whole hemispheres or even whole brains. We work closely with the <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/ftd/">Penn Frontotemporal Dementia Center</a> and the <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/adcc/">Penn Alzheimer's Disease Core Center</a> to develop and evaluate ex vivo pulse sequences, studying how to maximize sensitivity to the microscopic pathological features of interest. A further translational goal of this work is to take the lessons learned from senitizing <i>ex vivo</i> MRI, and work to transition these methods to <i>in vivo</i> use as disease biomarkers. We are currently developing pulse sequences and analysis pipelines to quantify both the spatial extent of iron across the cortex, and the specific cortical laminar distribution of iron in focal disease regions.</div>
      <div class="project-text">The figure below shows the relationship between <i>ex vivo</i> MRI, iron stain of matched histopathology slices, and then zoomed images of the underlying iron-rich disease pathology. Note how the two rows, representing two different proteinopathies, have different pathology at the microscale, but also different distributions of iron within the cortex (black "smudges" on MRI), that could represent "imaging signatures" of each disease.</div>
